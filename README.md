# Polyp-Segmentation

## 1. Introduction
* This repo is a simple research for polyp segmentation task. It is a combination of different great papers and works.
* The idea of this repo is mainly from three papers
  + **PraNet: Parallel Reverse Attention Network for Polyp Segmentation**
  + **Deep Layer Aggregation**
  + **Attentional Feature Fusion**
  + **ResNeSt: Split-Attention Networks**

## 2. Framework

Basically, I just did some minor changes to the PraNet:
* Change the Backbone from ResNet to ResNeSt
* Change feature aggregation to Iterative Feature Aggregation
* Change the Reverse Attention Mechanism to Multi-scale attention feature fusion
